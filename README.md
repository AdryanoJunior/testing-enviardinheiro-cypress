# My Cypress Automation

This project uses Cypress to automate testing a feature for successfully sending money from one account to another, and a feature where the transfer fails.
Cypress is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework that allows developers to write tests and eventually run them in a real browser.

## Installation
```bash
npm install
```
> **NOTE:**
>
> it is necessary to have **node** installed

## Running
```bash
# You open the Cypress UI
npx cypress open

# Run the automation by command line
npx cypress run
```
